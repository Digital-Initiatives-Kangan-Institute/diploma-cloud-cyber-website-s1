## 1. Purpose

This document records the current-state network topology of the YAT environment following the LMS cutover to AWS. The on-prem LMS server has been decommissioned; the LMS now runs in the AWS Sydney region and is reached from the YAT campus over the Internet (for end-user traffic) and over a Site-to-Site VPN (for back-office traffic such as LDAP authentication and ICT management). The remainder of YAT's services continue to run on-premises at the Cremorne campus.

## 2. Topology overview

![Network topology — YAT Cremorne campus plus AWS-hosted LMS (single-AZ baseline); Site-to-Site VPN linking the two](/diagrams/network-at3-start-non-hardened.drawio.svg)

The campus network is logically unchanged — two zones (Staff, Student) behind a redundant edge firewall, a staff-only VPN server for remote access, and the existing on-prem servers (Domain Controllers, System Management, Application Services, NAS) in their original locations. The on-prem LMS server has been decommissioned at cutover and is shown in the diagram as a vacated slot for clarity.

The LMS now runs in **AWS region `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney)** as a multi-tier web workload:

- **Internet Gateway** for end-user traffic into the public web subnet.
- **Application Load Balancer** in the public subnet, fronting the LMS application instances.
- **EC2 LMS application** in the private app subnet, running on Windows Server 2016 with DOODLE — managed by an Auto Scaling Group at a single-AZ baseline.
- **Amazon RDS for MySQL** in the private data subnet, single-AZ baseline.
- **NAT Gateway** providing outbound internet from the private subnets (Windows Updates, package fetches).
- **VPN Gateway** terminating the Site-to-Site VPN from the YAT campus edge firewall; used for AD-LDAP traffic from the LMS application back to YAT campus Active Directory, and for ICT management traffic.

End-user LMS access from YAT staff and student desktops flows over the campus internet connection to the AWS Application Load Balancer. The Site-to-Site VPN is reserved for back-office traffic (LDAP, management).

## 3. Component summary

### 3.1 On-premises components

| Component | Zone | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edge router / firewall | Perimeter | Redundant | No single point of failure at the network plumbing layer |
| VPN server | Perimeter | Single — SPOF | Staff-only remote access (unchanged from prior topology) |
| Site-to-Site VPN endpoint | Perimeter | Single | New post-cutover dependency — connects campus to AWS VPC |
| Domain Controllers (×2) | Staff | Redundant, load-shared | AD, DHCP, DNS — serve both zones; AD now also serves the cloud LMS over the Site-to-Site VPN |
| System Management server | Staff | Single — non-critical | Runs nightly backups for on-prem systems |
| Application Services server | Staff | Single | Accounting and office admin applications |
| NAS — Staff zone | Staff | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | |
| NAS — Student zone | Student | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | |
| Staff desktops | Staff | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise, AD-joined |
| Student desktops | Student | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise + Office 365 Education |
| Multifunction printers | Staff | n/a | Designated staff locations |
| Classroom printers | Student | n/a | One per classroom |

### 3.2 AWS components (LMS environment)

| Component | Subnet / Tier | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internet Gateway | VPC edge | AWS-managed | End-user traffic entry |
| VPN Gateway | VPC edge | Single endpoint | Terminates the Site-to-Site VPN from the campus |
| Application Load Balancer | `public-web-a` (10.0.1.0/24) | Single-AZ baseline | HTTPS:443 → LMS target group |
| NAT Gateway | `public-web-a` | Single-AZ baseline | Outbound for private subnets |
| EC2 — LMS application | `private-app-a` (10.0.11.0/24) | Single-AZ ASG (min=1, max=2) | Windows Server 2016 + DOODLE |
| RDS for MySQL | `private-data-a` (10.0.21.0/24) | Single-AZ baseline — not HA | Failover via point-in-time restore only at baseline |

## 4. Single points of failure

The current topology has a different SPOF profile from the prior all-on-premises arrangement:

**Resolved by the migration:**

- The on-prem LMS server SPOF has been resolved — the LMS is no longer single-instance on aged on-prem hardware.

**New or unchanged single points of failure:**

- **AWS RDS database — single-AZ.** At the post-cutover baseline the database is a single Multi-AZ-capable instance running in one AZ only. Failover under the baseline depends on point-in-time restore. **Identified target for the high-availability hardening phase.**
- **AWS EC2 LMS application — single-AZ ASG.** Auto Scaling can replace an instance, but all capacity is in one AZ. Identified target for the HA hardening phase.
- **AWS ALB and NAT Gateway — single-AZ.** Both are in `public-web-a` only. Identified targets for the HA hardening phase.
- **Site-to-Site VPN — single tunnel endpoint** at the campus end. AD-LDAP traffic from the LMS back to the campus relies on this link. Loss of the VPN does not stop end-user LMS access (that flows over the public internet) but does prevent fresh AD authentications from the cloud LMS until restored.
- **VPN server (campus, staff remote access)** — unchanged from prior topology; outside the LMS migration scope.
- **Application Services server** (Accounting / office admin) — unchanged from prior topology.
- **System Management server** — unchanged from prior topology.
