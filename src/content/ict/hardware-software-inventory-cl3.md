## Document control

| | |
|---|---|
| Document title | Hardware / Software Inventory — YAT Cremorne Campus and AWS Sydney |
| Document owner | Sam Walker, ICT Manager |
| Prepared by | YAT ICT |
| Review cycle | Annual, or on material change to the environment |
| Classification | Internal — ICT, and engaged consultants on signed MSA |

## 1. Purpose

This inventory records YAT's current ICT assets — campus servers, storage, endpoints, network equipment, software licensing, and the AWS-hosted LMS and website resources. It supports ICT planning, audit, change-management impact assessment, and the engagement of external consultants where their work touches the YAT environment.

## 2. Campus server inventory

| Server role | Quantity | Operating system | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Domain Controllers (AD / DHCP / DNS) | 2 | Windows Server 2016 | Load-shared across both zones; no single-system outage causes service outage |
| System Management and Backups | 1 | Windows Server 2016 | Single instance, explicitly non-HA. Runs nightly backups for on-prem systems |
| VPN | 1 | (purpose-built appliance / server) | Staff-only remote access; single instance |

## 3. Campus storage inventory

| Device | Quantity | Zone | Configuration |
|---|---:|---|---|
| NAS — staff zone | 1 | Staff | RAID-5, hot-swap disks |
| NAS — student zone | 1 | Student | RAID-5, hot-swap disks |

## 4. AWS resources

### 4.1 LMS environment

The LMS workload is deployed in AWS region `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney) across two availability zones (`ap-southeast-2a` and `ap-southeast-2b`) for resilience to single-AZ failure. The following resources comprise the LMS environment:

| Resource | Tier / Subnet | Configuration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| VPC | n/a | `10.0.0.0/16` | DNS hostnames and resolution enabled; flow logs to CloudWatch |
| Internet Gateway | VPC edge | AWS-managed | End-user traffic entry |
| VPN Gateway | VPC edge | Single endpoint | Terminates the Site-to-Site VPN from the campus |
| NAT Gateways | `public-web-a`, `public-web-b` | One per AZ | Outbound internet for the corresponding private subnets |
| Application Load Balancer | `public-web-a` + `public-web-b` | Cross-AZ | HTTPS:443 → LMS target group across both AZs; ACM-issued TLS certificate |
| EC2 instances — LMS application | `private-app-a`, `private-app-b` | Windows Server 2016 + DOODLE; cross-AZ Auto Scaling Group min=2, max=4 | Capacity in both AZs |
| Amazon RDS for MySQL — primary | `private-data-a` | Multi-AZ deployment; KMS-encrypted; 7-day automated backup retention | Synchronous replication to standby |
| Amazon RDS for MySQL — standby | `private-data-b` | Synchronous replica of primary | Automatic failover under two minutes |
| Amazon S3 — LMS attachments | n/a (regional) | Versioned; lifecycle to Glacier Deep Archive after 24 months; cross-Region backup copy | Course materials, student submissions |
| Amazon S3 — LMS backups | n/a (regional) | Versioned; private; access-logged; cross-Region backup copy | Off-instance backup copies |
| CloudWatch Logs | n/a | 90-day retention | VPC flow logs, ALB access logs, EC2 OS logs, RDS logs |

### 4.2 Website (separate 2023 pilot, not HA-hardened)

YAT's public website runs in the same AWS Sydney region as a separate single-Availability-Zone deployment. Unlike the LMS, it has **not** been HA-hardened — it remains the 2023 single-AZ pilot:

| Resource | Tier / Subnet | Configuration | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| VPC (Website) | n/a | Separate website VPC | Single-AZ; independent of the LMS environment |
| Internet Gateway (Website) | VPC edge | AWS-managed | Public inbound to the website over HTTPS |
| EC2 — Website | `public-web-a` | LAMP stack + CMS; single instance with an Elastic IP | The website; single point of failure |
| Amazon RDS for MySQL — Website | `private-data-a` | Single-AZ; KMS-encrypted | Website CMS database; single point of failure |
| Amazon S3 — Website backups | n/a (regional) | Versioned; private; no cross-Region copy | Nightly database and media backups |

### 4.3 Ledgerline (Accounting) environment

Ledgerline runs as an internal single-AZ workload in the same Sydney region — EC2 (Windows Server 2016 + Ledgerline) behind an internal Application Load Balancer, Amazon RDS for Microsoft SQL Server (single-AZ), and S3 for backups; reached from the campus over the Site-to-Site VPN. See the Accounting System Infrastructure Specifications and the Accounting Cloud Architecture — Baseline Design.

## 5. Endpoint inventory

| Endpoint | Approximate quantity | OS / Edition | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Staff desktops | ~25 | Windows 10 Enterprise | AD-joined |
| Student desktops | ~80 | Windows 10 Enterprise + Office 365 Education | AD-joined; lab machines provisioned with additional memory and storage where required |
| Multifunction printers | ~5 | n/a | Designated staff locations |
| Classroom printers | ~15 | n/a | One per classroom |

## 6. Network equipment

| Item | Quantity | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| Edge router / firewall | 2 (redundant) | No single point of failure at the network plumbing layer |
| Site-to-Site VPN endpoint (campus) | 1 | Connects the campus edge to the AWS VPN Gateway |
| LAN distribution switches — Staff zone | (per zone topology) | Connect servers, staff desktops, NAS, multifunction printers |
| LAN distribution switches — Student zone | (per zone topology) | Connect student desktops, classroom printers, Student-zone NAS |
| Wireless access points | (campus-wide coverage) | Staff and student wifi served on separated SSIDs |

## 7. Software and licensing inventory

|---|---|---|---|
| Windows Server 2016 (campus) | Microsoft | Per-server licensing | 3 campus servers (DC ×2, System Management) |
