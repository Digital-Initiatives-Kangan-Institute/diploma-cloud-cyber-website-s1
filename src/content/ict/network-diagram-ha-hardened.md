## 1. Purpose

This document records the current-state network topology of the YAT environment. The LMS runs in the AWS Sydney region as a multi-tier web workload deployed across two availability zones for resilience to single-AZ failure. The LMS is reached from the YAT campus over the Internet (for end-user traffic) and over a Site-to-Site VPN (for back-office traffic such as LDAP authentication and ICT management). The remainder of YAT's services continue to run on-premises at the Cremorne campus.

## 2. Topology overview

![Network topology — YAT Cremorne campus plus AWS-hosted LMS (Multi-AZ across ap-southeast-2a and ap-southeast-2b); Site-to-Site VPN linking the two](/diagrams/network-at3-end-ha-hardened.drawio.svg)

The campus network is logically unchanged — two zones (Staff, Student) behind a redundant edge firewall, a staff-only VPN server for remote access, and the remaining on-prem servers (Domain Controllers, System Management, NAS) in their original locations. Ledgerline (Accounting) runs in AWS as an internal single-AZ workload reached over the Site-to-Site VPN — migrated from the decommissioned on-prem Application Services server; see its Infrastructure Specifications and the Accounting Cloud Architecture — Baseline Design.

The LMS runs in **AWS region `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney)** as a multi-tier web workload deployed across two availability zones (`ap-southeast-2a` and `ap-southeast-2b`):

- **Internet Gateway** for end-user traffic into the public web subnets.
- **Application Load Balancer** spanning both availability zones, fronting the LMS application instances and distributing traffic to healthy targets.
- **EC2 LMS application** in private app subnets in both availability zones, running on Windows Server 2016 with DOODLE — managed by a cross-AZ Auto Scaling Group.
- **Amazon RDS for MySQL — Multi-AZ deployment**, with a primary in `ap-southeast-2a` and a synchronously-replicated standby in `ap-southeast-2b`; automatic failover under two minutes.
- **NAT Gateways** in each availability zone for outbound internet from the corresponding private subnets.
- **VPN Gateway** terminating the Site-to-Site VPN from the YAT campus edge firewall; used for AD-LDAP traffic from the LMS application back to YAT campus Active Directory, and for ICT management traffic.
- **Cross-Region S3 backup copy** of LMS attachments and database backups maintained in a secondary AWS region for disaster-recovery purposes.

End-user LMS access from YAT staff and student desktops flows over the campus internet connection to the AWS Application Load Balancer. The Site-to-Site VPN is reserved for back-office traffic (LDAP, management).

Separately from the LMS, YAT's **public website** runs in the same AWS Sydney region, also **hardened to Multi-AZ high availability** — a cross-AZ Application Load Balancer fronting an Auto Scaling Group of website instances across two availability zones, a Multi-AZ Amazon RDS for MySQL database with automatic failover, and media served from Amazon S3. The single-AZ single-instance points of failure of the original 2023 pilot have been removed. It is reached by the public over the Internet via HTTPS and is not connected to the campus network. (Global serving / edge delivery, cross-region DR, and the audit/access-log microservice are not yet in place — they are the current website expansion engagement.)

## 3. Component summary

### 3.1 On-premises components

| Component | Zone | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edge router / firewall | Perimeter | Redundant | No single point of failure at the network plumbing layer |
| VPN server | Perimeter | Single — SPOF | Staff-only remote access |
| Site-to-Site VPN endpoint | Perimeter | Single | Connects campus to AWS VPC |
| Domain Controllers (×2) | Staff | Redundant, load-shared | AD, DHCP, DNS — serve both zones; AD also serves the cloud LMS over the Site-to-Site VPN |
| System Management server | Staff | Single — non-critical | Runs nightly backups for on-prem systems |
| NAS — Staff zone | Staff | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | |
| NAS — Student zone | Student | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | |
| Staff desktops | Staff | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise, AD-joined |
| Student desktops | Student | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise + Office 365 Education |
| Multifunction printers | Staff | n/a | Designated staff locations |
| Classroom printers | Student | n/a | One per classroom |

### 3.2 AWS components (LMS environment)

| Component | Subnet / Tier | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Internet Gateway | VPC edge | AWS-managed | End-user traffic entry |
| VPN Gateway | VPC edge | Single endpoint | Terminates the Site-to-Site VPN from the campus |
| Application Load Balancer | `public-web-a` + `public-web-b` | Cross-AZ | HTTPS:443 → LMS target group across both AZs |
| NAT Gateway (×2) | `public-web-a` and `public-web-b` | One per AZ | Per-AZ outbound for the corresponding private subnets |
| EC2 — LMS application | `private-app-a` + `private-app-b` (10.0.11.0/24, 10.0.12.0/24) | Cross-AZ ASG (min=2) | Windows Server 2016 + DOODLE; capacity in both AZs |
| RDS for MySQL — primary | `private-data-a` (10.0.21.0/24) | Multi-AZ | Synchronous replication to standby in AZ-b |
| RDS for MySQL — standby | `private-data-b` (10.0.22.0/24) | Multi-AZ | Auto-failover under two minutes |
| S3 — LMS attachments | n/a (regional) | Cross-Region copy | Versioned; lifecycle to Glacier Deep Archive; cross-Region backup for DR |

### 3.3 AWS components (Website — HA-hardened, Multi-AZ)

| Component | Subnet / Tier | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Application Load Balancer — Website | `public-web-a` + `public-web-b` | Cross-AZ | HTTPS:443 → website target group across both AZs |
| EC2 — Website | `private-app-a` + `private-app-b` | Cross-AZ ASG (min=2) | LAMP / CMS; capacity in both AZs |
| RDS for MySQL — Website | `private-data-a` / `-b` | Multi-AZ | Primary + synchronous standby; automatic failover |
| S3 — website media + backups | n/a (regional) | Durable | Media served from S3 (offloaded from instance disk); nightly backups |

The website has been hardened to Multi-AZ alongside the LMS — see the Website Cloud Architecture — HA-Hardened Design for the full architecture.

## 4. Single points of failure

The current topology has been hardened against single-AZ failure for the LMS environment. The remaining single-instance components are outside the LMS migration scope:

**Resolved by the LMS migration and HA hardening:**

- The on-prem LMS server SPOF has been resolved — the LMS is no longer single-instance on aged on-prem hardware.
- AWS RDS, EC2, ALB, and NAT — previously single-AZ at the post-cutover baseline — have been hardened across two availability zones.
- The website's single-AZ single-instance points of failure have likewise been removed by its HA hardening (cross-AZ ALB + ASG + Multi-AZ RDS + media on S3).

**Remaining single-instance components (outside LMS migration scope):**

- **Site-to-Site VPN — single tunnel endpoint** at the campus end. AD-LDAP traffic from the LMS back to the campus relies on this link. Loss of the VPN does not stop end-user LMS access (that flows over the public internet) but does prevent fresh AD authentications from the cloud LMS until restored.
- **VPN server (campus, staff remote access)** — unchanged from prior topology.
- **Ledgerline (Accounting, AWS Sydney)** — migrated from the decommissioned on-prem Application Services server; single-AZ baseline (single Availability Zone + non-Multi-AZ database). An internal, business-hours system; resilience is a candidate for future improvement, outside the LMS migration scope.
- **System Management server** — unchanged from prior topology.
