## 1. Purpose

This document records the current-state network topology of the YAT College Cremorne campus. It supports ICT planning, change-management impact assessment, audit, and the engagement of external consultants where their work touches the YAT environment.

## 2. Topology overview

![Network topology — YAT Cremorne campus, with all servers in the Staff zone and AD-permissioned LMS access from the Student zone](/diagrams/network-starting-on-prem.drawio.svg)

The campus network is logically segmented into two zones — a **Staff network zone** and a **Student network zone** — separated at the edge firewall. Both zones reach the internet through redundant edge routing/firewalling. A staff-only VPN server provides remote access into the Staff zone.

All servers reside in the Staff zone. The Student zone holds student desktops, classroom printers, and the Student-zone NAS. The LMS server is reachable from the Student zone via permissioned access controlled by Active Directory.

## 3. Component summary

| Component | Zone | Redundancy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Edge router / firewall | Perimeter | Redundant | No single point of failure at the network plumbing layer |
| VPN server | Perimeter | Single — SPOF | Staff-only remote access |
| Domain Controllers (×2) | Staff | Redundant, load-shared | AD, DHCP, DNS — serve both zones |
| System Management server | Staff | Single — non-critical | Runs nightly backups for both zones |
| Application Services server | Staff | Single | Accounting and office admin applications; payroll critical functions are outsourced |
| **LMS server** | **Staff** | **Single — SPOF, end of life, mission critical** | **Identified migration target** |
| NAS — Staff zone | Staff | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | Not currently designated mission critical |
| NAS — Student zone | Student | RAID-5 (disk-level only) | Not currently designated mission critical |
| Staff desktops | Staff | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise, AD-joined |
| Student desktops | Student | n/a | Windows 10 Enterprise + Office 365 Education |
| Multifunction printers | Staff | n/a | Designated staff locations |
| Classroom printers | Student | n/a | One per classroom |

## 4. Single points of failure

The following single-instance components have been identified and recorded for risk management and forward planning:

- **LMS server** — single instance, end of life, mission critical. Primary driver of the current LMS Cloud Migration engagement.
- **VPN server** — single instance carrying all staff remote access. Not in scope for the LMS migration; flagged for separate consideration in a future ICT planning cycle.
- **Application Services server** (Accounting / office admin) — single instance. Partially mitigated by outsourcing the most critical functions (e.g. payroll).
- **System Management server** — single instance. Explicitly designated as not requiring high availability; restored from build records and tape in the event of failure.
