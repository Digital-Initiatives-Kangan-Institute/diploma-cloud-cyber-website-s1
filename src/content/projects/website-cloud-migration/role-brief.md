This brief sets out the roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships for the **MTS Website Cloud Migration** engagement — the migration of YAT’s public website from on-premises hosting to a simple cloud-hosted environment on AWS. The Master Services Agreement is the authoritative source for engagement scope and governance; this brief was the operational reference held by each role during the engagement. The engagement closed in May 2023 and this record is retained on the intranet for reference.

## Engagement context

YAT College engaged **MTS Consulting** to migrate its public website to the cloud. The on-premises web server hosting the Website was approaching end of warranty and strained during the January–February enrolment-enquiry peaks, and YAT’s ICT Strategic Plan set a direction of reducing dependency on in-house server infrastructure.

This was **YAT’s first cloud engagement** — chosen deliberately as a **low-risk pilot**. The public website was a sensible first candidate: less business-critical than the LMS or the Accounting system, so a good place for YAT and MTS to build cloud delivery confidence before the larger, mission-critical migrations that followed. The brief for this engagement was therefore *“get the Website running in the cloud, simply and cost-effectively”* — not to make it highly available. High availability and disaster recovery were explicitly out of scope (per the MSA), an accepted limitation of the pilot.

**How MTS staffs YAT’s engagements.** MTS runs several engagements with YAT as part of YAT’s cloud-transition program and assigns its consultants across those engagements as work demands. The role, reporting lines, and standards are the same on each.

## Scope of the MTS engagement

**In scope for MTS (this engagement):**

- Design and build a simple, single-AZ, cost-minimal AWS hosting environment in an Australian region
- Re-host the existing CMS; migrate the Website database, content, and static assets
- Configure DNS and TLS; smoke-test; support production Cutover
- As-built documentation, operations runbook, and knowledge transfer to YAT ICT

**Out of scope — retained by YAT or deferred:**

- High availability, autoscaling, and disaster recovery (deferred — an accepted pilot limitation)
- Website content, information architecture, and visual redesign (retained by YAT Marketing)
- Domain-registrar account changes beyond Cutover DNS updates (YAT ICT)
- Ongoing operational support after stabilisation (YAT ICT)

*This mirrors the YAT/MTS scope split on YAT’s other engagements: MTS leads the cloud-infrastructure work; YAT in-house teams retain content, application/data ownership, cutover business decisions, and ongoing support.*
