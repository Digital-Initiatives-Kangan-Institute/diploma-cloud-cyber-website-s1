## 1. Parties

**Client:** **YAT College Pty Ltd** (ABN 12 345 678 901), a Registered Training Organisation, of 175 Cremorne Street, Cremorne VIC 3121, Australia (**YAT**).

**Consultant:** **MP Tech Solutions Pty Ltd** (ABN 21 098 765 432) trading as **MTS Consulting**, of Level 4, 200 Smith Street, Collingwood VIC 3066, Australia (**MTS** or **the Consultant**).

YAT and MTS are referred to collectively as the **Parties** and individually as a **Party**.

## 2. Background

A. YAT operates a public-facing website (the **Website**) — marketing site, course catalogue, and online enquiry / application intake — together with its content management system (CMS) and supporting database. The Website was hosted on a single on-premises web server at the YAT Cremorne campus.

B. The on-premises web server was approaching end of warranty, and the Website experienced performance strain during the January–February enrolment-enquiry peaks. YAT’s ICT Strategic Plan sets a direction of reducing dependency on in-house server infrastructure.

C. YAT determined to migrate the Website to a cloud-hosted environment as a **deliberately low-risk first cloud engagement** — a pilot to build YAT’s and its consultancy’s confidence with cloud delivery ahead of the larger, mission-critical LMS and Accounting system migrations to follow. A simple, cost-minimal deployment was sought; high availability and disaster recovery were **expressly excluded** from this Engagement (see clause 5).

D. YAT selected MTS to provide the cloud infrastructure services described in this Agreement. MTS warrants that it has the capability, qualifications, and resources to provide the Services.

E. The Parties wish to record the terms on which MTS will provide the Services to YAT.

## 3. Definitions and interpretation

### 3.1 Definitions

In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Acceptance** | YAT’s written confirmation that a Deliverable meets the acceptance criteria in clause 8. |
| **Business Day** | A day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday in Victoria, Australia. |
| **Change Request** | A written request to vary the scope, deliverables, fees, or timing of the Services, raised and approved under clause 9. |
| **Change Management Procedure** | YAT’s documented ICT Change Management Procedure (intranet), incorporated into this Agreement by reference. |
| **CMS** | The content management system used to author and publish the Website. |
| **Confidential Information** | Information disclosed by one Party to the other that is identified as confidential or that a reasonable person would treat as confidential, including YAT-held personal information and any non-public technical, operational, or commercial information of either Party. |
| **Cutover** | The transition of Website service from the on-premises web server to the cloud-hosted environment, including DNS changes and ramp-down of the on-premises server. |
| **Deliverable** | An output, document, or running infrastructure component listed in clause 6. |
| **Effective Date** | The date set out at the top of this Agreement. |
| **Engagement** | The total of all work performed under this Agreement across both Phases. |
| **MSA** | This Master Services Agreement. |
| **Phase** | A phase of the Engagement as described in clause 4. |
| **Services** | The services to be performed by MTS as described in clause 4. |
| **Website** | YAT’s public-facing website, its CMS, and its supporting database, as described in clause 2.A. |

### 3.2 Interpretation

References to a Phase include all Deliverables and milestones within that Phase. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. The singular includes the plural and vice versa.

## 4. Services and scope of work

### 4.1 Engagement structure

MTS provided the Services in two sequential Phases:

| Phase | Title | Scope summary |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Migration Design and Build | Design a simple, cost-minimal AWS hosting environment for the Website in an Australian region; provision the cloud foundation (identity and access, virtual network, single compute instance, managed database, object storage for static assets); re-host the existing CMS and migrate the Website database and content; configure DNS and TLS; smoke-test the migrated Website. |
| Phase 2 | Cutover, Stabilisation and Handover | Execute production Cutover from the on-premises server; provide stabilisation support; produce as-built documentation and an operations runbook; conduct knowledge transfer to YAT ICT; produce the project Closure Pack and obtain closure sign-off under YAT’s Change Management Procedure. |

### 4.2 Detailed scope

Detailed scope is set out in the supporting project documents on the YAT intranet for this project — the Engagement Role Brief, the Website Migration Requirements, and the ICT Manager Consultation Notes.

MTS performed the Services with reasonable skill and care, by appropriately qualified personnel, and in compliance with YAT’s documented policies and procedures referenced in clauses 9 and 12 of this Agreement.

## 5. Out of scope

The following work is **not** included in this Engagement and remained the responsibility of YAT in-house teams, or was deferred to a later engagement as noted:

- **High availability and disaster recovery.** This pilot deploys a single Availability Zone baseline. Multi-AZ fault tolerance, autoscaling, cross-region disaster recovery, and any formal availability or recovery-time targets are expressly **out of scope** and deferred for YAT’s consideration in a later engagement.
- Website content authoring, information architecture, and visual redesign (retained by YAT Marketing; MTS migrated the existing site as-is);
- Domain-registrar account changes beyond the DNS record updates required for Cutover (managed by YAT ICT);
- Active Directory and email-platform changes beyond those required to preserve the enquiry-notification integration (managed by YAT ICT);
- Ongoing operational support of the Website after acceptance of the Phase 2 Closure Pack (retained by YAT ICT); and
- All routine end-user and public-visitor support.

Any change to this allocation required a Change Request under clause 9.

## 6. Deliverables and milestones

### 6.1 Phase 1 Deliverables

| Ref | Deliverable | Format | Acceptance evidence | Actual completion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1.1 | Website cloud hosting design | Written design (single-AZ baseline) | YAT ICT Manager review | 24 February 2023 |
| D1.2 | Cloud environment provisioned | Running cloud infrastructure | Smoke-test evidence; ICT Manager review | 17 March 2023 |
| D1.3 | Website re-hosted and migrated | Running Website on cloud (pre-Cutover) | Functional smoke-test; content and enquiry-form verification | 31 March 2023 |

### 6.2 Phase 2 Deliverables

| Ref | Deliverable | Format | Acceptance evidence | Actual completion |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D2.1 | Cutover executed | Production traffic on cloud Website; on-prem server in ramp-down | Post-cutover check (no Severity 1 incidents) | 14 April 2023 |
| D2.2 | As-built documentation and operations runbook | Written documentation set | YAT ICT acceptance | 28 April 2023 |
| D2.3 | Project Closure Pack | Closure Pack including residual-risk register and sign-off records | Closure sign-off under YAT Change Management Procedure | 12 May 2023 |

The residual-risk register filed with D2.3 explicitly recorded the single-AZ baseline (no high availability or disaster recovery) as an accepted residual risk for the pilot, to be revisited in a future engagement.

## 7. Term, suspension, and termination

### 7.1 Term

This Agreement commenced on the Effective Date and continued until Acceptance of Deliverable D2.3 (Phase 2 Closure Pack), which occurred on 12 May 2023.

## 8. Acceptance

### 8.1 Submission

MTS submitted each Deliverable to the YAT ICT Manager for review with all evidence specified in clause 6 for that Deliverable.

### 8.2 Review period

YAT reviewed each submitted Deliverable within **5 Business Days** of submission and either accepted it in writing or rejected it in writing, specifying the reasons by reference to the acceptance evidence requirements in clause 6.

### 8.3 Re-submission

Where a Deliverable was rejected, MTS remediated and re-submitted within a reasonable period agreed with YAT. The review cycle in clause 8.2 applied to each re-submission. The acceptance record for this Engagement shows one Deliverable required re-submission (D1.3 — minor enquiry-form notification defect), remediated and Accepted within agreed timeframes.

### 8.4 Phase progression

MTS did not commence Phase 2 Deliverables until all Phase 1 Deliverables had been Accepted.

## 9. Change control

Substantive changes to the scope, Deliverables, fees, or timing of the Services were governed by the YAT Change Management Procedure (incorporated by reference) and the Change Request process. A Change Request set out the proposed change, the reason, the impact on scope / Deliverables / fees / timing / risk, any rollout or rollback arrangements, and the proposed approval authority. Once approved by the YAT ICT Manager, a Change Request was appended to this Agreement as a numbered variation.
