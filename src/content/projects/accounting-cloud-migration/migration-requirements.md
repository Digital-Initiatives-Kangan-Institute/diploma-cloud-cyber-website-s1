## Context

The following functional and non-functional requirements for the Accounting & Office Administration system were established by YAT ICT and YAT Finance. Any option the MTS engagement recommends — renew on-premises or migrate to the cloud — must be evaluated against these requirements. The Consultation Notes filed against this engagement record the consultation these requirements were derived from.

## Requirements

The future operating model for the Accounting system must:

- **Preserve the existing application and database stack.** This is an operating-model change, not a software replacement. Any recommended option must continue to run the existing **Ledgerline** application on **Windows Server 2016** with its **Microsoft SQL Server** database. No in-flight application upgrade or database migration to a different engine is in scope.

- **Address the commercial licensing position.** Because Ledgerline and SQL Server are commercially licensed (unlike the open-source LMS stack), the recommendation must account for licensing under the proposed model — including, for a cloud option, whether SQL Server is licence-included or bring-your-own-licence, and the effect on total cost.

- **Achieve business-hours availability of at least 99.5%.** The system is a business-hours, staff-only service with payroll outsourced; it does not require the 24/7 mission-critical 99.9% target set for the LMS. The recommended option must demonstrate how it meets or exceeds 99.5% business-hours availability.

- **Meet recovery objectives appropriate to financial data.** Recovery Point Objective ≤ 1 hour (financial transactions must not be lost) and Recovery Time Objective ≤ 1 business day (≤ 8 business hours), reflecting that the system is business-hours-only and payroll is outsourced.

- **Keep all financial records and personal information within Australia.** Financial records and the personal information of staff and student debtors must remain onshore to support the *Privacy Act 1988* (APP 8) and Australian financial-records retention obligations. Any cloud option must deploy in an Australian region (e.g. AWS `ap-southeast-2`).

- **Support a 7-year financial-records retention obligation.** Storage and backup arrangements must support retention of financial records and audit logs for at least seven years.

- **Preserve existing integrations.** The recommended option must continue to support:
  - Active Directory authentication (single sign-on for staff)
  - Office 365 SMTP for invoice/statement and approval notifications
  - The LMS fee-status integration (enrolment data in, fee-status flags out)
  - Secure file transfer to the external payroll bureau
  - Secure banking / payment-gateway file exchange (ABA payment runs, direct-debit fee collection)

- **Scale for predictable peaks without over-provisioning.** The workload is light and business-hours, with predictable month-end and EOFY peaks (~45–55 concurrent users). The recommended option should size for these peaks cost-effectively rather than carrying year-round capacity for an occasional peak.

- **Cut over outside finance-critical periods.** Any transition must avoid month-end close (last 2 / first 2 business days of each month) and the EOFY period (mid-June to mid-July).

- **Maintain vendor support.** The Ledgerline vendor support and maintenance contract must remain in place; the recommended option must be compatible with the vendor's supported deployment configurations.
