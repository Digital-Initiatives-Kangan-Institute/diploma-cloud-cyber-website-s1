> Produced by the MTS Senior Architecture team, in consultation with YAT ICT, and approved for implementation (v1.0).

The baseline AWS architecture for the YAT Accounting System cloud migration — the single-Availability-Zone Sydney (`ap-southeast-2`) foundation for the Ledgerline finance and office-administration application: IAM, VPC and networking, compute (EC2 + Auto Scaling), an internal Application Load Balancer, RDS for Microsoft SQL Server, storage, security, and a monitoring baseline. High-availability hardening is deferred to the follow-on HA design phase.

The document specifies the architecture to be implemented, the design assumptions and constraints, the configuration decisions left to the implementer, and what is explicitly out of scope.
