## 1. Context

As the Accounting System cloud migration enters its high-availability hardening phase, YAT requires the Ledgerline database service to be re-deployed as a fault-tolerant, multi-AZ managed database. The single-instance PostgreSQL database deployed during the cloud foundation build must be upgraded to — or replaced with — a service that meets the high-availability requirements stated below, **without loss of financial data and without changing the Ledgerline application**.

## 2. Requirements

The high-availability database service for the migrated Accounting System must:

- **Be PostgreSQL-compatible.** Ledgerline runs on PostgreSQL (per the Accounting System Application Specification). The HA database service must run PostgreSQL or a fully compatible managed equivalent so that Ledgerline continues to operate without code or schema changes.

- **Replicate data across availability zones.** Data must be replicated synchronously to a standby instance in a different availability zone within the same AWS region (ap-southeast-2), so that no committed financial transaction is lost if an availability zone fails (RPO ≤ 1 hour must be preserved).

- **Provide automatic failover.** If the primary instance fails, the database must automatically promote the standby and resume service with no manual intervention and no application reconfiguration (the application reaches the database by name).

- **Run on the same cloud vendor as the rest of the migrated environment.** The HA database service must use AWS (consistent with the cloud foundation already deployed) so that networking, IAM, and operational tooling remain coherent.

- **Be a managed service.** To minimise the management and maintenance effort required by YAT ICT staff — whose cloud expertise is still being built — the database must use a managed database service offered by the cloud vendor (e.g. Amazon RDS Multi-AZ for PostgreSQL) rather than self-hosted PostgreSQL on an EC2 instance.

- **Preserve the existing protections.** Encryption at rest (KMS), automated + transaction-log backups, and the 7-year financial-records retention established in the baseline must be carried through unchanged.
