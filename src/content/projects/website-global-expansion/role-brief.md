This brief sets out the roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships for the MTS Website Global Expansion & Disaster Recovery engagement. The Master Services Agreement (§§4–5, §10) is the authoritative source for engagement scope and governance; this brief is the operational reference held by each role during day-to-day work.

## Engagement context

YAT College has engaged MTS Consulting to extend the public website cloud platform to support YAT's new offshore campus partnership in India, and to make the platform recoverable in a disaster. The website is YAT's public front door for prospective students; the partnership brings a global, India-based prospective-student audience to it. The engagement is structured in two sequential Phases:

1. **Phase 1 — Disaster Recovery Plan.** Design of the changes required to serve a global user base; design of the cross-region disaster recovery approach against agreed recovery objectives; design of the infrastructure-as-code approach and the data-residency arrangement (including the audit/access-log microservice); preparation of the Disaster Recovery Plan and supporting solution design; and presentation of the plan to YAT for approval before any implementation.
2. **Phase 2 — Implementation.** Implementation of the approved design — web-scale serving, the audit/access-log microservice, cross-region backup and recovery, and infrastructure-as-code — with validation, documentation, operational handover, and finalisation for sign-off under YAT's Change Management Procedure.

Cloud infrastructure work is in scope for MTS; the website content and CMS application, the India-cohort enquiry handling, cutover, organisational change management, and end-user support are retained by YAT in-house teams (Marketing & Admissions owns the website content; ICT owns the platform). The scope split is summarised in §3 below and detailed in the Master Services Agreement.
