| **Effective date** | 1 July 2026 |
| **Project** | Website Global Expansion & Disaster Recovery |

## 1. Parties

**Client:** **YAT College Pty Ltd** (ABN 12 345 678 901), a Registered Training Organisation, of 175 Cremorne Street, Cremorne VIC 3121, Australia (**YAT**).

**Consultant:** **MP Tech Solutions Pty Ltd** (ABN 21 098 765 432) trading as **MTS Consulting**, of Level 4, 200 Smith Street, Collingwood VIC 3066, Australia (**MTS** or **the Consultant**).

YAT and MTS are referred to collectively as the **Parties** and individually as a **Party**.

## 2. Background

A. YAT operates its public website (the **Website**) — its marketing site, course catalogue, and online enquiry / application intake, running on an open-source PHP / MySQL content management system — which was migrated to AWS in 2023 and subsequently hardened to Multi-AZ high availability under prior engagements between the Parties (the website cloud migration and the website HA hardening), now complete.

B. YAT has entered a strategic education partnership establishing an offshore campus in India (located in GIFT City, Gujarat). The Website is YAT's public front door for prospective students, and the new partnership brings a global, India-based prospective-student audience to it.

C. YAT has determined that, to support the partnership, the Website cloud platform must be extended to serve a global user base, to provide cross-region disaster recovery, to be provisioned and reproducible as code, and to meet the data-residency obligations applicable to the new cohort.

D. As with the prior engagement, the cloud infrastructure work is to be delivered by an external consultancy under this Agreement, while the website content, the CMS application, cutover, and organisational change-management components are retained and delivered by YAT in-house teams (Marketing & Admissions and ICT).

E. YAT has selected MTS to provide the cloud infrastructure services described in this Agreement. MTS warrants that it has the capability, qualifications, and resources to provide the Services.

F. The Parties wish to record the terms on which MTS will provide the Services to YAT.

### 3.2 Interpretation

References to a Phase include all Deliverables and milestones within that Phase. Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation. The singular includes the plural and vice versa.

## 4. Services and scope of work

### 4.1 Engagement structure

MTS will provide the Services in two sequential Phases:

| Phase | Title | Scope summary |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Disaster Recovery Plan | Design of the changes required to extend the Website for a global user base; design of the cross-region disaster recovery approach against agreed recovery objectives; design of the infrastructure-as-code approach and the data-residency arrangement (including the audit/access-log microservice); preparation of the Disaster Recovery Plan and supporting solution design; and presentation of the plan to YAT for approval before any implementation. |
| Phase 2 | Implementation | Implementation of the design approved at the conclusion of Phase 1: web-scale serving, the audit/access-log microservice, cross-region backup and recovery, and provisioning of the infrastructure as code; validation and testing; documentation, operational handover, and finalisation for sign-off under YAT's Change Management Procedure. |

### 4.2 Detailed scope

Detailed scope for each Phase is set out in the supporting project documents:

- **Phase 1 scope** is anchored by the Engagement Role Brief, the Functional & Non-Functional Requirements, the Data Residency & Sovereignty Requirements, and the as-built record of the existing (now-complete) Website cloud environment (all on the YAT intranet for this project).
- **Phase 2 scope** is anchored by the solution design and Disaster Recovery Plan approved at the conclusion of Phase 1.

MTS will perform the Services with reasonable skill and care, by appropriately qualified personnel, and in compliance with YAT's documented policies and procedures (referenced in clauses 9 and 12 of this Agreement).

## 5. Out of scope

The following work is **not** included in this Engagement and remains the responsibility of YAT in-house teams:

- Website content authoring and the configuration of the CMS application on any infrastructure provided by MTS, and any application-level integration work required to emit the events consumed by the audit/access-log microservice;
- Onboarding of the India-campus intake, including marketing content and enquiry-handling process changes;
- Production cutover of any extended or recovered service, including DNS changes, dual-running window operations, and post-cutover incident response;
- All organisational change-management activities, including Change Advisory Board process, communications to staff, and end-user support;
- Negotiation of the offshore partnership and any legal determination of the data-residency obligations themselves (MTS designs to the obligations as recorded in the Data Residency Requirements); and
- All routine end-user support, helpdesk, and YAT-side operational ICT activities.

This out-of-scope allocation may be varied only by a Change Request under clause 9.
