| Document title | LMS Cloud Architecture — Baseline Design |
| Document type | Technical design |
| Version | 1.0 — Approved for implementation |
| Authored by | MTS Senior Architecture Team, in consultation with YAT ICT |
| Approved by | Pat Lin, MTS Senior Consultant · Sam Walker, YAT ICT Manager |
| Classification | Internal — YAT ICT, and MTS personnel on signed MSA |

## 1. Purpose and scope

This document specifies the baseline AWS architecture to be implemented by MTS as the first build phase of the YAT LMS cloud migration. It translates the action plan approved at the close of the Business Case engagement into a concrete, implementable design.

**In scope (this design):**

- Production cloud foundation for the DOODLE LMS application
- All compute, networking, identity, storage, database, autoscaling, and monitoring components required to run the LMS as a multi-tier web workload in AWS
- Single-region, single-Availability-Zone deployment in `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney)

**Out of scope (this design — deferred to the follow-on HA design phase):**

- High-availability hardening (Multi-AZ database, cross-AZ compute resilience, failure-simulation testing)
- Disaster recovery to a second AWS region
- DR runbook and tabletop testing
- Application re-platforming (the LMS remains Windows Server 2016 + DOODLE + MySQL per the engagement brief)

**Out of MTS scope entirely — handled by YAT ICT:**

Per the Engagement Role Brief § Scope of the MTS consulting engagement, the following activities are YAT ICT's responsibility, not MTS's. The MTS-built infrastructure must be ready to support them, but MTS does not execute them:

- **LMS application installation** — DOODLE LMS install on the EC2 instance(s) once handover is complete
- **Database migration** — extract from on-prem MySQL, load into AWS RDS (see §7.2 below — recorded for engagement-wide visibility only)
- **Cutover** — DNS switch, parallel running, decommissioning, user redirection
- **Organisational change management** — Change Advisory Board approvals, end-user communications, staff and student training, post-cutover support ramp

This design therefore stops at *infrastructure ready for application deployment* — the EC2 instance is provisioned with the OS via AMI, the RDS instance is provisioned with an empty MySQL schema, the ALB is configured with placeholder health checks, but no application binaries or production data are placed on the infrastructure as part of the MTS build.

## 2. Design assumptions and constraints

| # | Assumption / Constraint | Source |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | Region must be `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney) for data residency | LMS Application Specification § Data residency; YAT Privacy Policy |
| A2 | LMS application stack preserved: Windows Server 2016, MySQL, DOODLE LMS | Engagement Role Brief |
| A3 | Current data footprint ~178 GB, growing ~25 GB / year (course attachments and student submissions dominate) | LMS Application Specification § Data stored |
| A4 | Concurrent users typical 200–300, peak 500–700 during assessment windows | LMS Application Specification § User population |
| A5 | All YAT student personal information must remain within Australia | *Privacy Act 1988* (Cth), APP 8 |
| A6 | LMS authenticates via Active Directory; the cloud build must preserve AD-LDAP integration over private network back to YAT campus AD | LMS Application Specification § Authentication / SSO |
| A7 | This baseline is **not** high-availability. Achieving YAT's 99.9% availability target is deferred to the follow-on HA design phase. | Scoping decision |

## 3. AWS account and region

- **AWS account:** scoped to the LMS migration engagement, provisioned by YAT and shared with MTS personnel for the duration of the build.
- **Region:** `ap-southeast-2` (Sydney). No deployment outside Australian regions.
- **Availability Zone:** `ap-southeast-2a` for the baseline deployment. The follow-on HA design phase will introduce a second AZ.

## 4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### 4.1 IAM groups and access pattern

| Group | Purpose | Indicative permissions |
|---|---|---|
| `YAT-ICT-Admins` | YAT internal ICT staff — day-to-day operations after handover | Read-only on infrastructure; full access to CloudWatch, RDS console, EC2 console (no IAM modifications) |
| `MTS-Consultants` | MTS personnel during build and ongoing support | Full administrative access during build; reduced post-handover |
| `Application-Service` | EC2 instance role used by the LMS application itself | RDS read/write to LMS database; S3 read/write to attachments bucket; CloudWatch logs write |
| `Read-Only-Auditors` | YAT compliance and external auditors | Read-only on logs, metrics, configurations — no service mutations |

### 4.2 IAM principles

- Use AWS managed policies where available; custom inline policies only when no managed policy fits.
- **MFA required** for all user accounts in `YAT-ICT-Admins` and `MTS-Consultants` (per ACSC Essential Eight and the YAT User Access Policy).
- No long-lived access keys for human users; programmatic access via IAM roles only.
- Resource access by EC2 instances via instance profile, not embedded credentials.

**Configuration decision left to implementer:** specific permission boundaries on the `MTS-Consultants` group during build vs after handover.

## 5. Network topology

### 5.1 VPC

- **VPC CIDR:** `10.0.0.0/16` (private RFC1918 range, room for future expansion)
- **DNS hostnames and DNS resolution:** enabled
- **VPC flow logs:** enabled to CloudWatch Logs

### 5.2 Subnets (single AZ — `ap-southeast-2a`)

| Subnet | CIDR | Tier | Internet-facing? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public-web-a` | `10.0.1.0/24` | Web / public load balancer | Yes |
| `private-app-a` | `10.0.11.0/24` | Application / LMS EC2 instances | No |
| `private-data-a` | `10.0.21.0/24` | Database (RDS) | No |

> The follow-on HA design phase will add the corresponding `-b` subnets in `ap-southeast-2b`.

### 5.3 Gateways and routing

- **Internet Gateway** attached to the VPC for public-subnet traffic.
- **NAT Gateway** in `public-web-a` for outbound internet from the private app subnet (e.g. Windows Updates, package management).
- **Route tables:**
  - Public route table — default route to Internet Gateway; associated with `public-web-a`.
  - Private app route table — default route to NAT Gateway; associated with `private-app-a`.
  - Private data route table — no default route to internet; associated with `private-data-a`.

### 5.4 Connectivity back to YAT campus

The LMS must reach YAT's on-campus Active Directory for authentication. Two options were considered:

- **Option (a) — Site-to-Site VPN** between YAT campus router and an AWS VPN Gateway. Lower setup cost; acceptable for AD-LDAP traffic.
- **Option (b) — AWS Direct Connect** dedicated link. Higher cost; considered only if VPN latency becomes a problem at scale.

**Baseline choice for this design: Option (a) Site-to-Site VPN.** Direct Connect deferred unless required by later performance assessment.

## 6. Compute layer

### 6.1 EC2 instances (LMS application tier)

- **Instance family:** general-purpose x86 (e.g. `m6i.large` or `m5.large` — see configuration decision below)
- **AMI:** Windows Server 2016 Datacentre (preserves current application stack per A2)
- **Placement:** `private-app-a` subnet only (no public IPs on application instances)
- **EBS root volume:** `gp3`, 100 GB
- **Additional EBS data volume:** `gp3`, sized to cover LMS application data and attachments — implementer to compute size from the data footprint in the LMS Application Specification plus 12-month growth and 50% headroom

### 6.2 Application Load Balancer (ALB)

- **Placement:** `public-web-a` (internet-facing)
- **Listener:** HTTPS:443 → forward to LMS target group
- **Target group:** EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling Group (see §6.3)
- **Health check:** HTTP GET against LMS health endpoint; 30-second interval; threshold 2 unhealthy → instance taken out of service
- **TLS certificate:** ACM-issued for the LMS DNS name (implementer to confirm DNS strategy with YAT ICT)

### 6.3 Auto Scaling Group (ASG)

- **Launch template:** as specified in §6.1
- **Capacity (baseline):** min=1, desired=1, max=2
- **Scaling policy:** target tracking on EC2 CPU at **70%** (configurable)
- **Health checks:** ELB + EC2
- **Cooldown:** 300 seconds

> The follow-on HA design phase will expand ASG capacity (min=2, multi-AZ) and add a load-based scaling policy tuned to assessment-window peaks.

**Configuration decision left to implementer:** specific instance type from the general-purpose family, based on the workload sizing in the LMS Application Specification.

## 7. Database layer

### 7.1 RDS for MySQL

- **Engine:** Amazon RDS for MySQL (preserves current MySQL data and schema per A2)
- **Engine version:** confirm against DOODLE's supported MySQL version matrix at build time
- **Instance class:** general-purpose (e.g. `db.m6i.large` or `db.m5.large` — implementer selects based on workload)
- **Multi-AZ:** **disabled** for the baseline; the follow-on HA design phase enables Multi-AZ.
- **Storage:** `gp3`, initial size sized to cover the LMS MySQL data footprint + 12-month growth — implementer computes size
- **Storage encryption:** enabled (AWS KMS — AWS-managed key acceptable for baseline)
- **Placement:** `private-data-a` subnet group
- **Public accessibility:** disabled
- **Backup retention:** 7 days, automated; backup window 22:00–04:00 AEST (aligns with current LMS maintenance window per the LMS Application Specification)
- **Maintenance window:** Sunday 02:00–06:00 AEST (preserved from current LMS maintenance window)

### 7.2 Schema migration *(out of MTS scope — YAT ICT responsibility, recorded here for completeness)*

> Per the Engagement Role Brief § Scope of the MTS consulting engagement, **data migration is YAT ICT's responsibility**, not MTS's. MTS provisions the RDS instance per §7.1 above; YAT ICT performs the schema and data load once the infrastructure is handed over.
>
> Recorded here for engagement-wide visibility only — MTS implementers do not perform data migration as part of the build.

Indicative approach YAT ICT is expected to follow (subject to YAT ICT's own change management):

1. Full `mysqldump` + restore during the cutover window, **or**
2. AWS DMS continuous replication during a cutover-with-rollback period.

YAT ICT's expected baseline choice: `mysqldump` + restore during a planned maintenance window. DMS reserved for if extended parallel-running is needed. Final method is YAT ICT's call, not MTS's.

## 8. Storage

| Resource | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| EC2 root volume | EBS `gp3` 100 GB | OS and LMS application install |
| EC2 application data volume | EBS `gp3` (sized by implementer) | LMS application data, attachments staging |
| LMS attachments bucket | S3 (`yat-lms-attachments-<env>-<region>`) | Course attachments and student submissions, with lifecycle to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 24 months |
| Backups bucket | S3 (`yat-lms-backups-<env>-<region>`) | Off-instance copies of `mysqldump` exports, application file snapshots |

**S3 settings (both buckets):**

- Block all public access
- Server-side encryption (SSE-S3 acceptable for baseline)
- Versioning enabled
- Access logging to a dedicated log bucket

## 9. Security

### 9.1 Security groups

| Security group | Inbound | Outbound |
|---|---|---|
| `sg-alb` | HTTPS:443 from `0.0.0.0/0` | HTTP/HTTPS to `sg-app` |
| `sg-app` | HTTP/HTTPS from `sg-alb`; RDP:3389 from MTS bastion (bastion design left to implementer) | MySQL:3306 to `sg-db`; HTTPS to NAT Gateway for outbound updates; LDAP/LDAPS to YAT campus AD over VPN |
| `sg-db` | MySQL:3306 from `sg-app` only | none |

### 9.2 Encryption in transit

- ALB → EC2: HTTPS (LMS supports HTTPS application traffic)
- EC2 → RDS: TLS-protected MySQL connection
- All AWS service-to-service calls over TLS via VPC endpoints where available

### 9.3 Encryption at rest

- EBS volumes: enabled (default KMS key acceptable for baseline)
- RDS storage: enabled
- S3 buckets: SSE-S3

### 9.4 Shared security responsibility

This deployment operates under the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model**.

| Layer | Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| AWS regions, AZs, hardware, hypervisor | "Security of the cloud" | AWS |
| Guest OS patching (Windows Server 2016) | "Security in the cloud" | YAT ICT (post-handover) + MTS support |
| Application configuration and LMS application security | "Security in the cloud" | YAT ICT |
| IAM users, groups, MFA, key management | "Security in the cloud" | YAT ICT |
| Data classification, access governance, audit | "Security in the cloud" | YAT |
| End-user device security | "Security in the cloud" | YAT and end users |

## 10. Monitoring baseline

### 10.1 CloudWatch metrics

Standard service metrics enabled for: EC2 (CPU, network, disk), RDS (CPU, connections, free storage, replication lag — not applicable for single-AZ), ALB (request count, target response time, 5XX count), Auto Scaling (group capacity, scale events).

### 10.2 CloudWatch alarms (baseline only — HA-tuned alarms come in the follow-on HA design phase)

| Alarm | Metric | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| EC2 CPU high | `AWS/EC2 CPUUtilization` ≥ 80% over 10 min | (sustained) | Notify; ASG scaling policy may have already acted |
| RDS CPU high | `AWS/RDS CPUUtilization` ≥ 80% over 10 min | (sustained) | Notify |
| RDS free storage low | `AWS/RDS FreeStorageSpace` < 15% | | Notify; trigger manual storage scale |
| ALB 5XX | `AWS/ApplicationELB HTTPCode_Target_5XX_Count` > 10/min | | Notify |
| RDS connections high | `AWS/RDS DatabaseConnections` > 80% of `max_connections` | | Notify |

### 10.3 Logging

- VPC flow logs → CloudWatch Logs (90-day retention)
- ALB access logs → S3 access-log bucket
- EC2 OS-level logs via CloudWatch Agent (Windows Event Log critical channels)
- RDS general and error logs → CloudWatch Logs

## 11. Naming and tagging conventions

### 11.1 Resource naming

Pattern: `yat-lms-<resource-type>-<env>-<az-or-purpose>` — e.g. `yat-lms-alb-prod`, `yat-lms-rds-prod`, `yat-lms-asg-prod`.

### 11.2 Mandatory tags

| Tag | Value | Required on |
|---|---|---|
| `Project` | `YAT-LMS-Migration` | All resources |
| `Environment` | `Production` | All resources |
| `Owner` | `YAT-ICT` | All resources |
| `ManagedBy` | `MTS-Migration` (during build); change to `YAT-ICT` post-handover | All resources |
| `CostCentre` | `YAT-LMS` | All resources |
| `DataClassification` | `Confidential` (anything touching student PII) or `Internal` | EBS, RDS, S3 buckets |

## 12. Backup baseline

| Resource | Mechanism | Retention | Restore-tested by |
|---|---|---|---|
| RDS database | Automated daily backups + transaction log retention | 7 days | Build-phase connectivity testing |
| EC2 EBS volumes | Daily AMI snapshot via Data Lifecycle Manager | 14 days | Restore validation in the follow-on HA design phase |
| LMS attachments (S3) | S3 Versioning + lifecycle to Glacier Deep Archive | Versioned; archive after 24 months | Handover testing |
| Configuration / IaC | IaC tooling choice and drift-detection setup left to the implementer | n/a | n/a |

> Cross-Region backup copies are out of scope for this baseline and addressed in the follow-on HA design phase.

## 13. Out of scope (deferred to follow-on HA design phase)

Listed explicitly so the implementer knows what *not* to build:

- Multi-AZ database
- Cross-AZ subnets (`private-app-b`, `private-data-b`)
- ASG capacity ≥ 2 across multiple AZs
- HA-tuned monitoring (e.g. cross-AZ latency, RDS replica lag)
- Cross-Region backup copies and DR runbook
- Failure-simulation testing
- Automated availability metric reporting (e.g. service-level dashboard against the 99.9% target)

These are the deliberate inputs into the follow-on HA design phase.

## 14. Configuration decisions left to the implementer

The supplied design is intentionally **opinionated where it matters and silent where the implementer must demonstrate judgement**:

| # | Decision | Why left open | Where the decision is to be evidenced |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Specific EC2 instance type within the general-purpose family | Implementer must size against the LMS workload | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C2 | Specific RDS instance class within the general-purpose family | Same | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C3 | EBS application data volume size + RDS storage size | Implementer must compute from data footprint + growth | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C4 | ASG scaling threshold within the recommended range | Implementer rationalises against expected CPU profile | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C5 | Permission boundary policy specifics for `MTS-Consultants` | Implementer adapts to lab environment access scope | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C6 | Bastion / jump-host design for RDP access into `sg-app` | Left for implementer | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C7 | MySQL engine version | Implementer confirms against DOODLE compatibility matrix | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
| C8 | DNS strategy and ACM certificate domain | Implementer confirms with YAT ICT for the LMS hostname | Deployment Report — Configuration decisions |
