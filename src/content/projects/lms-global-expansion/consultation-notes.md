## Discussion

### Context and starting point

Sam Walker opened by setting the scene. The LMS is now cloud-hosted and highly available following the prior engagement, and that environment is the starting point — this engagement extends it, it does not rebuild it. The driver is the new education partnership: YAT is standing up an offshore campus in India (GIFT City), and that cohort will use the same LMS. Sam emphasised two outcomes for this work: the platform has to **reach** the new cohort acceptably, and — given a partner institution will now depend on it — it has to be **recoverable** if something goes badly wrong. Sam framed recovery as the headline of this engagement.

### Global reach and what "global" means

Pat asked Sam to be specific about "global user base." Sam clarified that, for now, "global" means **the India cohort plus the existing Australian cohort** — he is not asking for a worldwide rollout. But he wants the design to **not paint YAT into a corner**: if a second offshore partner appears later, the approach should extend without a re-architecture.

Sam stressed the LMS is **read-heavy** — students mostly pull course content, recordings, and materials, with comparatively little writing back. He wants the India cohort to get acceptable response times despite the distance, and asked MTS to factor content delivery into the design rather than simply hosting everything in Australia and hoping. Pat noted that edge content delivery is the usual answer to that and would be covered in the plan.

### Disaster recovery — the priority

Sam confirmed the recovery numbers carried over from the existing platform: **RPO of 1 hour** (no more than an hour of lost data) and **RTO of 4 hours** (operational again within four hours of an incident being declared).

The important extension Sam made: he wants recovery to survive the loss of **an entire region**, not just a single availability zone. The prior engagement handled in-region fault tolerance; this engagement is about **what happens if the whole primary region is unavailable**. That is why a second region is in scope. Sam was clear he is not asking for an always-on duplicate — a recover-into-the-second-region approach that meets the 4-hour / 1-hour targets is acceptable, and he would prefer the simpler, cheaper option that still meets the numbers.

### Data residency — a compliance gate

Sam was emphatic that data residency is **non-negotiable** for the India cohort. Certain records and operational logs for the India operation have to be held **in India** — this is a compliance gate, not a nice-to-have, and the plan has to show it is met.

He was equally clear about scope, to avoid over-reach: it is **specific data** — the access/activity logs and the records the obligation names — that must sit in India, **not the whole system**. The main LMS database can remain in Australia. Sam asked that MTS work to the residency requirements as written up separately (the Data Residency & Sovereignty Requirements), and not try to interpret the law themselves — YAT's compliance area owns that, MTS designs to it.

### The audit / access-log service

Pat raised how the in-India logging would actually work. Sam explained the split: **YAT's application team** will arrange for the LMS to emit the relevant access/activity events; **MTS** is to build the service that receives those events and writes them to the in-India log store. Sam wants this service kept **separate and decoupled** from the LMS itself, so that logging load or a logging outage can never drag down the LMS. Pat confirmed a small event-driven service is the right shape and that MTS would design the event contract as part of the plan.

### Infrastructure-as-code

Sam wants the new footprint **reproducible**. His words: "if we have to stand the India side up — or stand it up again after a failure — I don't want it done by hand." He asked that the changes be delivered as templates that can be pointed at a region and deployed consistently. Pat noted this also underpins the recovery story: the recovery region can be provisioned from the same templates. Sam liked that the recovery and the reproducibility requirements reinforce each other.

### Keep it simple, protect the existing cohort

Two closing points Sam pressed:

- **Keep it simple.** The India campus is new and budget-conscious. Sam does not want gold-plating — the simplest arrangement that genuinely meets the targets.
- **Don't disturb the Australian cohort.** Whatever is done for the new cohort must not degrade the availability or performance the existing students already have.

### Change management and approval

Sam confirmed the engagement follows YAT's Change Management Procedure. Critically, he wants to **approve the Disaster Recovery Plan before any implementation begins** — the plan presentation is the gate. High-risk implementation steps will need sign-off as usual.

## Agreed next steps

- **MTS to produce:** the solution design and the Disaster Recovery Plan (risk and impact analysis, recovery objectives, recovery strategy, validation approach), with the audit/access-log service and the infrastructure-as-code approach included.
- **MTS to present:** the Disaster Recovery Plan to YAT for approval before implementation.
- **Sam to provide:** the finalised Data Residency & Sovereignty Requirements for the India cohort.
- **Sam to confirm:** the YAT application team's commitment to emit the access/activity events the logging service will consume.
- **Sam to authorise:** MTS consultant accounts on AWS Academy for the engagement.
