## Context

The following functional and non-functional requirements for the LMS Global Expansion & Disaster Recovery engagement were established by YAT ICT during engagement setup, following consultation with the YAT ICT Manager (see the Consultation Notes filed against this project for the consultation record this list was derived from). They set the targets the engagement is delivered against and are referenced by the Disaster Recovery Plan and the subsequent implementation. The data-residency obligations referenced below are detailed in the separate Data Residency & Sovereignty Requirements for this project.

The starting point for the engagement is the existing LMS cloud environment delivered and hardened under the prior LMS Cloud Infrastructure engagement (now complete). This engagement extends that environment; it does not rebuild it.

## Functional requirements

The extended YAT LMS must:

- **Serve a global user base.** The platform must serve the new India-campus cohort in addition to the existing Australian cohort, delivering course content to geographically distant users with acceptable latency.

- **Provide a disaster recovery capability in a second region.** The LMS must be recoverable in a second AWS region following a disaster that affects the primary region. Recovery must not depend on the primary region being available.

- **Capture and retain an audit/access log in-region.** Access and activity events for the India cohort must be captured and written to a log store located in an Indian region, to meet the applicable data-residency obligations. This is to be delivered by a dedicated, decoupled service that receives events and records them — independent of the core LMS so that it does not affect LMS availability.

- **Be provisioned as infrastructure-as-code.** The infrastructure changes must be defined as parameterised templates, so the environment can be reproduced consistently and stood up in another region by changing configuration (e.g. the target region) rather than rebuilding by hand.

## Non-functional requirements

- **Recovery objectives — RTO ≤ 4 hours, RPO ≤ 1 hour.** In a disaster affecting the primary region, the LMS must be recoverable with no more than 1 hour of data loss (RPO ≤ 1 hour) and back to operational service within 4 hours (RTO ≤ 4 hours).

- **Maintain availability for the existing cohort — ≥ 99.9%.** The changes must not degrade the 99.9% availability already achieved for the Australian cohort under the prior engagement.

- **Global performance.** The India cohort must receive acceptable response times. The LMS workload is read-heavy (course content delivery), which the design should take into account.

- **Scale with demand.** Scalable components must scale up and down automatically with demand. YAT's LMS load varies substantially across the academic calendar — roughly 3× concurrent users during the two-week assessment-submission windows at the end of each term, and very low load overnight and during term breaks. The new cohort adds to this load.

- **Data residency.** Records and operational logs relating to the India cohort must be retained in an Indian region, as set out in the Data Residency & Sovereignty Requirements. The bulk of LMS data may remain in the Australian region except where those requirements provide otherwise.

- **Preserve the OS and application stack.** No change to the LMS operating system or application software versions as part of this engagement.

- **Cost-effectiveness.** The solution should be the simplest arrangement that meets these requirements. Unnecessary complexity or cost is to be avoided.

- **Security and compliance.** The changes must comply with YAT's documented ICT policies (User Access, Acceptable Use, Privacy / Data Handling, Security and Incident Response).
